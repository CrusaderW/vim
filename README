==============

I forked this Repo from [crahles]. Thanks for the great work.
I changed the theme to [jellybeans.vim], as I prefer more darkness and less pastel-colors.

I also included the 2 bundles [vim-scala] and [sbt-vim], to enable scala-support in VIM. This was inspired by http://bleibinha.us/blog/2013/08/my-vim-setup-for-scala.

Install (not tested yet)
-------------
```
$ git clone https://github.com/CrusaderW/vim.git ~/.vim && ~/.vim/bundle/neobundle.vim/bin/neoinstall
```
